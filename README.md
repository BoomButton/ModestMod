# ModestMod
The Modest Mod is a collection of vital bugfixes and tweaks to the core Dwarf Fortress game that everyone should be able to use comfortably and without reservation. This mod doesn't add anything new. It doesn't do anything controversial. It's just like vanilla DF, but a little better. French vanilla.

This is the development version of the Modest Mod. If you just want to download the Modest Mod to use in your DF game, you can find the latest release at http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=11601.
